# Hey, I'm Yahya 👋
I've been coding since childhood, so long that I can’t even remember my first line of code.

I'm a versatile developer with a broad skill set. Here’s a snapshot of what I do:

- 🎮 Game Development

- 🔍 Reverse Engineering (Cracking & API Reversing on iOS and Android)

- 🌐 Fullstack Development

- 🎨 Frontend Design

- ...and much more.

My primary languages are **JavaScript** and **Python**, but I also work with:

*C#*, *C++*, *C*, and *Go (Golang)*

Feel free to reach out on Telegram @YMoulki if you have any questions or projects—I’m always open to interesting work!
